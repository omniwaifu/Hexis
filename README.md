# AGI Memory System

Postgres-first “agent brain”: memories, goals, a scheduled heartbeat, and a stateless worker that bridges the DB to LLM/embedding services.

## Overview

This repo provides:

- Multiple memory types (Episodic, Semantic, Procedural, Strategic)
- Vector-based memory storage and similarity search
- Graph-based memory relationships
- Working memory system
- A gated, autonomous heartbeat (runs only after `agi init`)

## Quickstart

Prereqs: Docker Desktop + Python 3.10+.

### 1) Configure environment

```bash
cp .env.local .env
```

### 2) Start services

```bash
# Passive (db + embeddings)
docker compose up -d
```

### 3) (Optional) Configure the agent (`agi init`)

Autonomous heartbeats are **gated** until setup is complete:

```bash
./agi init  # or `agi init` if you've installed the package

# If you want autonomy:
docker compose --profile active up -d worker
```

Config is stored in Postgres in the `config` table (e.g. `agent.objectives`, `agent.guardrails`, `llm.heartbeat`, and `agent.is_configured`).

### 4) Use the Python client (thin DB client)

Install:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Example:

```python
import asyncio
from cognitive_memory_api import CognitiveMemory, MemoryType

DSN = "postgresql://agi_user:agi_password@localhost:5432/agi_db"

async def main():
    async with CognitiveMemory.connect(DSN) as mem:
        await mem.remember("User prefers dark mode", type=MemoryType.SEMANTIC, importance=0.8)
        ctx = await mem.hydrate("What do I know about the user's UI preferences?", include_goals=False)
        print([m.content for m in ctx.memories[:3]])

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Usage Scenarios

Below are common ways to use this repo, from “just a schema” to a full autonomous agent loop.

### 1) Pure SQL Brain (DB-Native)

Your app talks directly to Postgres functions/views. Postgres is the system of record and the “brain”.

```sql
-- Store a memory (embedding generated inside the DB)
SELECT create_semantic_memory('User prefers dark mode', 0.9);

-- Retrieve relevant memories
SELECT * FROM fast_recall('What do I know about UI preferences?', 5);
```

### 2) Python Library Client (App/API/UI in the Middle)

Use `cognitive_memory_api.py` as a thin client and build your own UX/API around it.

```python
from cognitive_memory_api import CognitiveMemory

async with CognitiveMemory.connect(DSN) as mem:
    await mem.remember("User likes concise answers")
    ctx = await mem.hydrate("How should I respond?", include_goals=False)
```

### 3) MCP Tools Server (LLM Tool Use)

Expose memory operations as MCP tools so any MCP-capable runtime can call them.

```bash
agi mcp
```

Conceptual flow:
- LLM calls `remember_batch` after a conversation
- LLM calls `hydrate` before answering a user

### 4) Worker + Heartbeat (Autonomous State Management)

Turn on the worker so the database can schedule heartbeats and process `external_calls`.

```bash
docker compose --profile active up -d worker
```

Conceptual flow:
- DB decides when a heartbeat is due (`should_run_heartbeat()`)
- Worker queues/fulfills LLM calls (`external_calls`)
- DB records outcomes (`heartbeat_log`, new memories, goals, etc.)

### 5) Headless “Agent Brain” Backend (Shared Service)

Run db+embeddings(+worker) as a standalone backend; multiple apps connect over Postgres.

```text
webapp  ─┐
cli     ─┼──> postgres://.../agi_db  (shared brain)
jobs    ─┘
```

### 6) Per-User Brains (Multi-Tenant by DB)

Operate one database per user/agent for strong isolation (recommended over mixing tenants in one schema).

Conceptual flow:
- `agi_db_alice`, `agi_db_bob`, ...
- Each app request uses the user’s DSN to read/write their own brain

### 7) Local-First Personal AGI (Everything on One Machine)

Run everything locally (Docker) and point at a local OpenAI-compatible endpoint (e.g. Ollama).

```bash
docker compose up -d
agi init   # choose provider=ollama, endpoint=http://localhost:11434/v1
```

### 8) Cloud Agent Backend (Production)

Use managed Postgres + hosted embeddings/LLM endpoints; scale stateless workers horizontally.

Conceptual flow:
- Managed Postgres (RDS/Cloud SQL/etc.)
- `N` workers polling `external_calls` (no shared state beyond DB)
- App services connect for RAG + observability

### 9) Batch Ingestion + Retrieval (Knowledge Base / RAG)

Treat the system as a durable memory store and retrieval layer for your app.

```bash
agi ingest --input ./documents
```

Conceptual flow:
- Ingest documents into semantic memories
- Serve `hydrate()` / `recall()` for prompt augmentation

### 10) Evaluation + Replay Harness (Debuggable Cognition)

Use the DB log as an audit trail to test prompts/policies and replay scenarios.

```sql
-- Inspect recent heartbeats and decisions
SELECT heartbeat_number, started_at, narrative
FROM heartbeat_log
ORDER BY started_at DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### 11) Tool-Gateway Architecture (Safe Side Effects)

Keep the brain in Postgres, but run side effects (email/text/posting) via an explicit outbox consumer.

Conceptual flow:
- Heartbeat queues outreach into `outbox_messages`
- A separate delivery service enforces policy, rate limits, and/or human approval
- Delivery service marks messages `sent/failed` and logs outcomes back to Postgres

## Architecture

## Technical Stack

- **Database**: PostgreSQL with extensions:
  - pgvector (vector similarity)
  - AGE (graph database)
  - btree_gist
  - pg_trgm

## Environment Configuration

Copy `.env.local` to `.env` and configure:

```bash
POSTGRES_DB=agi_db           # Database name
POSTGRES_USER=agi_user       # Database user
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=agi_password # Database password
POSTGRES_HOST=localhost      # Database host
POSTGRES_PORT=5432          # Host port to expose Postgres on (change if 5432 is in use)
```

If `5432` is already taken (e.g., another local Postgres), set `POSTGRES_PORT=5433` (or any free port).

### Resetting The Database Volume

Schema changes are applied on **fresh DB initialization**. If you already have a DB volume and want to re-initialize from `schema.sql`, reset the volume:

```bash
docker compose down -v
docker compose up -d
```

## Testing

Run the test suite with:

```bash
# Ensure services are up first (passive is enough; tests also use embeddings)
docker compose up -d

# Run tests
pytest test.py -q
```

## Python Dependencies

Install (editable) with dev/test dependencies:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

If you’re in a restricted/offline environment and build isolation can’t download build deps:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]" --no-build-isolation
```

## Docker Helper CLI

If you install the package (`pip install -e .`), you get an `agi` CLI. If you don’t want to install anything, use the repo wrapper `./agi` instead.

```bash
agi up
agi ps
agi logs -f
agi down
agi init
agi status
agi config show
agi config validate
agi demo
agi chat --endpoint http://localhost:11434/v1 --model llama3.2
agi ingest --input ./documents
agi worker
agi mcp
```

## MCP Server

Expose the `cognitive_memory_api` surface to an LLM/tooling runtime via MCP (stdio).

Run:

```bash
agi mcp
# or: python -m agi_mcp_server
```

The server supports batch-style tools like `remember_batch`, `connect_batch`, `hydrate_batch`, and a generic `batch` tool for sequential tool calls.

## Heartbeat Worker

The autonomous heartbeat runs via a stateless background worker that:
- polls `external_calls` for pending LLM work
- triggers scheduled heartbeats (`start_heartbeat()`)
- executes heartbeat actions and records the result

### Turning The Worker On/Off

You generally want **two modes**:

- **Passive / RAG-only**: use `hydrate()/recall()/remember()` without autonomous execution → run **no worker**
- **Active / autonomous**: process `external_calls`, run scheduled heartbeats, and do maintenance → run **the worker**

With Docker Compose:

```bash
# Default (passive mode): start db + embeddings only
docker compose up -d

# Active mode: start db + embeddings + worker
docker compose --profile active up -d

# Start only the worker (and its dependencies)
docker compose --profile active up -d worker

# Stop the worker (container stays)
docker compose stop worker

# Stop + remove the worker container
docker compose rm -f worker

# Restart the worker
docker compose restart worker

# Passive mode: run DB + embeddings only (no worker)
docker compose up -d db embeddings
```

### Running Locally (Optional)

You can also run the worker on your host machine (it will connect to Postgres over TCP):

```bash
agi worker
```

If you already have an existing DB volume, the schema init scripts won’t re-run automatically. The simplest upgrade path is to reset the DB volume:

```bash
docker compose down -v
docker compose up -d
```

User/public outreach actions are queued into `outbox_messages` for an external delivery integration.

## Outbox Delivery (Side Effects)

High-risk side effects (email/SMS/posting) should be implemented as a separate “delivery adapter” that consumes `outbox_messages`, performs policy/rate-limit/human-approval checks, and marks messages as `sent` or `failed`.

## RabbitMQ (Default Inbox/Outbox Queues)

The Docker stack includes RabbitMQ (management UI + AMQP) as a default “inbox/outbox” transport:

- Management UI: `http://localhost:15672`
- AMQP: `amqp://localhost:5672`
- Default credentials: `agi` / `agi_password` (override via `RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_USER` / `RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_PASS`)

When the worker is running with `RABBITMQ_ENABLED=1`, it will:
- publish pending DB `outbox_messages` to the RabbitMQ queue `agi.outbox`
- poll `agi.inbox` and insert messages into DB working memory (so the agent can “hear” them)

This gives you a usable outbox/inbox even before you wire real email/SMS/etc. delivery.

Conceptual loop:

```sql
-- Adapter claims pending messages (use SKIP LOCKED in your implementation)
SELECT id, kind, payload
FROM outbox_messages
WHERE status = 'pending'
ORDER BY created_at
LIMIT 10;
```

## Embedding Model + Dimension

The embeddings model and its vector dimension are configured in `docker-compose.yml` via:
- `EMBEDDING_MODEL_ID`
- `EMBEDDING_DIMENSION`
 
If you change `EMBEDDING_DIMENSION` on an existing database volume, reset the DB volume so the vector columns and HNSW indexes are created with the correct dimension.

## Performance Characteristics

- **Vector Search**: Sub-second similarity queries on 10K+ memories
- **Memory Storage**: Supports millions of memories with proper indexing
- **Cluster Operations**: Efficient graph traversal for relationship queries
- **Maintenance**: Requires periodic consolidation and pruning

### Scaling Considerations
- Memory consolidation recommended every 4-6 hours
- Database optimization during off-peak hours
- Monitor vector index performance with large datasets

## System Maintenance

The memory system requires three key maintenance processes to function effectively:

### 1. Memory Consolidation
Short-term memories need to be consolidated into long-term storage. This process should:
- Move frequently accessed items from working memory to permanent storage
- Run periodically (recommended every 4-6 hours)
- Consider memory importance and access patterns

### 2. Memory Pruning
The system needs regular cleanup to prevent overwhelming storage:
- Archive or remove low-relevance memories
- Decay importance scores of unused memories
- Run daily or weekly, depending on system usage

### 3. Database Optimization
Regular database maintenance ensures optimal performance:
- Reindex tables for efficient vector searches
- Update statistics for query optimization
- Run during off-peak hours

### Implementation Note
These maintenance tasks can be implemented using:
- Database scheduling tools
- External task schedulers
- System-level scheduling (cron, systemd, etc.)

Choose the scheduling method that best fits your infrastructure and monitoring capabilities. Ensure proper logging and error handling for all maintenance operations.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Database Connection Errors:**
- Ensure PostgreSQL is running: `docker compose ps`
- Check logs: `docker compose logs db`
- Verify extensions: Run test suite with `pytest test.py -v`

**Memory Search Performance:**
- Rebuild vector indexes if queries are slow
- Check memory_health view for system statistics
- Consider memory pruning if dataset is very large

## Usage Guide

### Memory Interaction Flow

The AGI Memory System provides a layered approach to memory management, similar to human cognitive processes:

1. **Initial Memory Creation**
   - New information enters through working memory
   - System assigns initial importance scores
   - Vector embeddings are generated for similarity matching

2. **Memory Retrieval**
   - Query across multiple memory types simultaneously
   - Use similarity search for related memories
   - Access through graph relationships for connected concepts

3. **Memory Updates**
   - Automatic tracking of memory modifications
   - Importance scores adjust based on usage
   - Relationships update dynamically

4. **Memory Integration**
   - Cross-referencing between memory types
   - Automatic relationship discovery
   - Pattern recognition across memories

### Key Integration Points

- Use the Postgres functions (direct SQL) or `cognitive_memory_api.CognitiveMemory`
- Implement proper error handling for failed operations
- Monitor memory usage and system performance
- Regular backup of critical memories

### Best Practices

- Initialize working memory with reasonable size limits
- Implement rate limiting for memory operations
- Regular validation of memory consistency
- Monitor and adjust importance scoring parameters

## Important Note

This database schema is designed for a single AGI instance. Supporting multiple AGI instances would require significant schema modifications, including:

- Adding AGI instance identification to all memory tables
- Partitioning strategies for memory isolation
- Modified relationship handling for cross-AGI memory sharing
- Separate working memory spaces per AGI
- Additional access controls and memory ownership

If you need multi-AGI support, consider refactoring the schema to include tenant isolation patterns before implementation.
